swift spritekit game
Build by LUSS Studio


CHECK-LIST:
1. change array to dict which store key-value pair as playerId and Player object.
2. finish PlayerNode’s moving(postion: CGPoint) API
3. Passing move data to other user. --> Actually it is already implemented, but with step 2, it will not show other user’s moving.
4. need to check collision for player
5. problem with bad access in “data.getBytes(&messageMove, length: sizeof(MessageMove))”
